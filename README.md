# ALX Listing App

A simple **Airbnb clone listing page** built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
The goal of this project is to create a scalable and maintainable frontend structure for displaying property listings with reusable components and responsive design.

## Project Structure

- **`components/`** – Contains reusable UI components such as `Card` and `Button` used throughout the project.  
- **`interfaces/`** – Holds TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `CardProps`, `ButtonProps`) to enforce type safety.  
- **`constants/`** – Stores reusable constants like API URLs, placeholder images, or other configuration data.  
- **`public/assets/`** – Stores images, SVGs, and other static assets used in the app.  
- **`pages/`** – Next.js Pages Router files (e.g., `index.tsx`) which define the routes of the application.  

## Running the Project Locally
